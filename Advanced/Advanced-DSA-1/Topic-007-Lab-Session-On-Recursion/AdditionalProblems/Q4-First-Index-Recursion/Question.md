# Problem: Find First Index of an Element in an Array (Recursive)

## Problem Description

You are given an array `A` of size `N`. Write a recursive function that returns the first index at which an integer `B` is found in the array.

**NOTE**: If `B` is not found anywhere in the array then return `-1`.

## Problem Constraints

*   `1 <= N <= 100`
*   `-1000 <= A[i] <= 1000`
*   `-1000 <= B <= 1000`

## Input Format

The function contains two arguments:
1.  The first argument is the array `A`.
2.  The second argument is the element `B` that is to be searched.

## Output Format

Return the Index of `B` from the list in integer format if `B` is present in the array, else return `-1`.

## Example Input

### Input 1:

A = [-3, 5, 6, 2]
B = 6

### Input 2:
A = [0, 1, 0, 2]
B = 3

## Example Output

### Output 1:
2

### Output 2:
-1

## Example Explanation

For Input 1:
At index 0 we have -3
At index 1 we have 5
At index 2 we have 6 which is equal to B

For Input 2:
The element B = 3 is nowhere to be found in the array so we print -1

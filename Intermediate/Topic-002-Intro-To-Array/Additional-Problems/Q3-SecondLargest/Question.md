# Problem: Find the Second Largest Element in an Array

## Description

Given an integer array `A`, find the value of the second largest element. If the array does not contain a second largest element (e.g., all elements are the same, or the array has only one element), report that no such element exists by returning `-1`.

## Constraints

*   `1 <= |A| <= 10^5` (Array size is between 1 and 100,000)
*   `0 <= A[i] <= 10^9` (Value of elements are non-negative)

## Input Format

The first argument is an integer array `A`.

## Output Format

Return the value of the second largest element. Return `-1` if no second largest element exists.

## Examples

### Input 1:

A = [2, 1, 2]

### Output 1:

1

### Explanation 1:

The first largest element is 2. The second largest element is 1.

### Input 2:

A = [2]

### Output 2:

-1

### Explanation 2:

There is only one element, so there is no second largest element in the array.

# Problem: Count Factors of an Integer

## Description

Given an integer `A`, the goal is to determine the total count of its factors.

A factor of a number is defined as any integer that divides the number perfectly, leaving no remainder.

*Example: The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.*

## Constraints

*   `1 <= A <= 10^9`

## Input Format

The input is a single integer `A`.

## Output Format

The output should be the total count of factors of `A`.

## Examples

`5`

### Output 1:

`2`

### Explanation 1:

`The factors of 5 are 1 and 5.`

### Input 2:

`10`

### Output 2:

`4`

### Explanation 2:

`The factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10.`
